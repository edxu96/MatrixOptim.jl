# Stochastic Programming {#Sto}

> Stochastic programming is a framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty, if the probability distributions governing the data are known or can be estimated. The goal here is to find some policy that is feasible for all (or almost all) the possible data instances and maximizes the expectation of some function of the decisions and the random variables.

> Stochastic dynamic programming deals with problems in which the current period reward and/or the next period state are random, i.e. with multi-stage stochastic systems. The decision maker's goal is to maximize expected (discounted) reward over a given planning horizon.

> Decision outcomes need to be characterized not only by their expected values but also by their variability levels, thus risk control of outcome volatility is needed and can be achieved using appropriate risk measures. [@conejo2010decision]
