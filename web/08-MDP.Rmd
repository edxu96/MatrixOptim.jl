# Markov Decision Process (MDP) {#MDP}

Markov chain is a special kind of stochastic processes, which can be used to model lots of phenomena. Usually, to describe the system is not enough, because the managers or engineers may want to optimize the system performance. So Markov decision processes can be used to include the decisions to be made and formulate the optimization problem.
